GT-CODE is a project that aims to solve augmented reality exercises inspired by the GTA game.

# Introduction 

The exercises were based on HiuKim Yuen's [web augmented reality course](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-web-ar-development/),
I recommend the purchase even for a better use. Thus, the exercises here called "missions"
were within one of several areas of augmented reality called "image detection".

To understand more about image tracking I will leave some support links:

## What is the difference between GTA and GT-CODE ??

- GTA: It is an action-adventure video game.

- GT-CODE: A series of augmented reality **missions** with image detections inspired by GTA San Andreas.

## Missions

If you've played GTA you know that to evolve in the game you must do the **missions**. In this way, each exercise in augmented reality we will call **missions**,
If you've played GTA you know that to evolve in the game you must do the missions. In this way, each exercise in augmented reality we will call missions,
as the number of missions increases, a new functionality will be added.
Example :

- If mission 1 is just projecting an image, mission 2 will be projecting the image and adding an audio to the image.
